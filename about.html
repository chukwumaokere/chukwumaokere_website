    <div><h3>Web developing by day, still developing at night.</h3>
     <p>Of all the websites on the World Wide Web, you've chosen to visit this one. So, I'll try to 

make your visit worth your while.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Chukwuma (but you can call me Chuck for the sake of simplicity). I take it you've 

come here to learn a bit about me; so, here we go. I've been considered a jack of all trades, 

but never a "master of none", fortunately.</p>

<p>I'm great with communication and am usually always reachable. I strive to always provide 

exceptional customer service. I love multi-tasking and working with deadlines. Troubleshooting 

has always been fun to me. I'm often asked why I study subjects like theoretical physics and 

why I do things like programming. The answer is quite simple: problem-solving. I love puzzles. 

I enjoy having to think outside the box or come up with a solution on my own. That is the main 

reason I do things like that. To encounter an obstacle and be forced to think creatively to 

solve it and then solving it: that is one of the greatest feelings imaginable.</p>

<p>I started coding on a contract basis in 2006 as a C++/AngelScript coder for a few small 

indepedent video game companies. I worked on coding NPC's for the companies and quickly moved 

up to creating classes and doing database work for some private servers. 2 years later, I 

started my own private server and hosted a video game for my group of friends and even 

attempted to publicize it. But as I was entering high school, I had to switch my focus. </p>

<p>I started and continued through Lane Tech College Prep as an art major with an emphasis on 

digital art, photography and design but graduated as a Biology Major. I switched because I 

wanted to deal with more complex problem solving like dealing with the fragility of human 

systems (as if computers weren't hard enough). While at Lane Tech, I did a lot of contracted 

photography work. I now am a retired photography and offer free photoshoots for aspiring 

models and free photoshoots for events. Feel free to contact me for any of this by the way. 

Donations are welcome, but definitely not necessary.</p>

<p>I went through university at Saint Xavier University in Chicago, IL as a Pre-Med/Biology 

Major and had a great time developing the knowledge I had of the human body as it pertains to 

medicine and even graduated from Northwestern's HPREP program as top of the class (don't 

worry, I have a certificate to prove it). While attending the University, I also did a lot of 

research work under the supervision of Dr. Ricardo Monzon, Ph. D. This is where I truly got to 

put love for research and problem solving to work. I'm currently working on two medical 

research projects as the lead researcher, under Dr. Monzon's supervision, for creating a cure 

for Type I diabetes and creating pluripotent stem-cells using differentiated adult cells, both 

of which I wrote the proposals for. Both research projects are currently on hiatus as we wait 

for grant approvals.</p>

<p>To pay for all the expenses of school and living away from home, I had to get a job. So I 

started working at Dick's Sporting Goods in 2013. Working here allowed me to do the thing I 

loved still: problem-solving. I worked as a cashier when I first started but quickly gained 

experience and began working in 3 other departments. My main department, which I have been 

lead trained for, was footwear. I had the pleasure of being able to help customers with foot 

problems which allowed me to employ my medical knowledge and utilize my skills in problem 

solving. It was a great joy working there but I realized that higher up had a few problems. 

I'm not talking about personal management issues; I'm talking about technological issues.</p>

<p>The most recent department I worked for was the "Ship from Store" ECommerce department. There, I was 

in charge of the store's online orders. I had to process, fulfill, and manage the stores daily 

online orders. While using their programs to do this, I constantly would ponder how I would 

improve on their framework.</p>

<p>While working at Dicks Sporting Goods, I became good friends with my managers and while 

talking to each of them I realized there was a consistent problem in the workplace. The 

schedule maker program they use. The managers would tell me how the schedule maker that Dick's 

Sporting Goods provides was practically good for nothing. It would get all the names into a 

spreadsheet format, but it had a hard time generating a proper schedule that made sense. Often 

times it would schedule the same employee in two different departments at the same time, or 

not schedule any cashiers for the entire work day, etc. So I made a goal in 2015 to create a 

proper scheduling system for my managers at Dicks Sporting Goods. Codename: Project 

OPHION.</p>

<p>Alongside my contracted work, I also enjoy developing my own websites and managing others. 

My first solo project is named OPHION. It is an employee handler. It started as a solution for 

my most recent retail employer at Dick's Sporting Goods, but quickly evolved into what it is 

now: The World's Best Employee Handler. It is capable of handling all employee information in 

one directory for managers and other employees to look through to contact each other and also 

capable of generating schedules with any specifications that the user may decide on. I 

consider it the "smart scheduler". It also features a companion app that allows employees and 

employers to message each other, request time off, obtain contact information, and view 

generated schedules. The app will be available (hopefully) in Q3 2016. OPHION aims to be the 

ulimate solution for employee management for businesses of any size, from small "Mom and Pop" 

stores to large scale international businesses. I also help develop and manage other websites, 

two of which are text-overflow.com and allowfullscreen.com</p>

<p>Currently, I spend a lot of time working on my solo project OPHION, PHP coding and 

Wordpress development. My other skills are definitely not diminished so if you need any work 

done within those fields, contact me at any time and I'd be more than happy to assist you to 

my fullest ability.</p>

<p>I am dominantly a PHP developer with strong HTML/CSS background. I also possess proficiency 

in MySQL, Wordpress (with themes), jQuery, wamp, Navicat, JavaScript, CodeIgniter, UX/UI work.
You can contact me for any work regarding the above, as well as: C++, the full Adobe Suite, 

Video-Game development (modeling, animating, developing) using: Unreal Engine, UDK, CryEngine, 

RealFlow, 3DS Max, Maya, ZBrush, Blender, and Poser Pro
Photography/Video recording and editing: using programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, After 

Effects, Flash, Premiere, and Cinema 4D
Music production, mixing/mastering in: FL Studio, Melodyne, Audition
I can also help you with lost data retrieval or server work.
Oh and I can also fix your cracked phone screen. Don't worry, it's probably salvagable. 
</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="contactme.html">contact me</a> regarding anything that I listed above, or if something you need 

done isn't listed, contact me anyway and I might know how to do it, or I could help you find 

someone who can! Thanks for taking the time to visit my website. I hope you enjoyed your stay. 

If you didn't please <a href="feedback.html">send me some feedback</a> so I can know what to 

do to make your next visit more enjoyable.</p>

<p>You're so brave to be traveling the World Wide Web by yourself, but as a wise man once said, 

"It's dangerous to go alone! <a href="Okere, Chukwuma Resume.docx">Take this.</a>"</p>
